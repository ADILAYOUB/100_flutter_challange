# Flutter SQLite CRUD Operation

This Flutter project demonstrates a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation using SQLite in a Flutter application. It allows you to perform database operations such as creating records, retrieving records, updating records, and deleting records.

## Features

- Create records: Add new data entries to the SQLite database.
- Read records: Fetch and display existing records from the database.
- Update records: Modify and update existing records in the database.
- Delete records: Remove unwanted records from the database.

## Screenshots

Include relevant screenshots of the application in action. For example, you can showcase the user interface for adding a new record, displaying existing records, updating records, and deleting records.
