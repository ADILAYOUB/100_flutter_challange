# Movie Search App

This is a movie search app built using Flutter and Riverpod for state management. The app allows users to search for movies based on genre, release year, and rating. It fetches movie data from an external API and displays relevant results to the user.

## Features

- Search movies by genre, release year, and rating.
- View movie details including title, release date, rating, and overview.
- Save favorite movies for future reference.
- Dark mode support for enhanced user experience.

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can download Flutter from the official Flutter website: [https://flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev)

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ADILAYOUB/100_flutter_challange/tree/12
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 12
   ```

4. Fetch the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Riverpod State Management

Riverpod is used as the state management solution for this app. It provides a simple and intuitive way to manage and share state across different parts of the app.

The app architecture is divided into three main layers:

1. **UI Layer:** Contains the user interface components and widgets.

2. **Provider Layer:** Manages the state and exposes it to the UI layer using Riverpod providers. It includes providers for fetching movie data, filtering movies based on user input, and managing favorite movies.

3. **Data Layer:** Handles the fetching of movie data from an external API. It uses HTTP requests to retrieve movie information based on user input.

## API Integration

The app integrates with an external movie API to fetch movie data. The API provides endpoints for searching movies based on genre, release year, and rating. The app makes HTTP requests to these endpoints and receives JSON responses, which are then parsed and displayed to the user.

## Configuration

To configure the API integration, open the `lib/config.dart` file and update the following constant variables:

```dart
const String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const String apiBaseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';
```

Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key, and `'https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs'` with the base URL of the movie API.
